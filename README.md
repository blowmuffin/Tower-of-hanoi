This code is an implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion in the C programming language. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following certain rules. The goal is to move all the disks from the source peg to the destination peg, using a temporary peg, while adhering to the following rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the top disk from one peg and placing it on another peg.
No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Now, let's break down the code step by step:

#include<stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input-output library, which is needed for using functions like printf and scanf.

void tower(int n, char s, char h, char d): This is a recursive function named tower that takes four arguments:

n: The number of disks to be moved.
s: The source peg from which disks need to be moved.
h: The helper peg used for temporary storage.
d: The destination peg to which disks need to be moved.
if(n==0) return;: This is the base case of the recursion. If there are no disks to move (n equals 0), the function returns immediately.

Recursive calls:

tower(n-1, s, h, d);: This line makes a recursive call with n-1 disks, moving them from the source (s) peg to the helper (h) peg.
printf("%c -> %c \n", s, d);: This line prints the movement of the top disk from the source (s) peg to the destination (d) peg.
tower(n-1, h, s, d);: This line makes another recursive call with n-1 disks, moving them from the helper (h) peg to the destination (d) peg.
int main(): This is the main function where the program execution starts.

int n;: Declares an integer variable n to store the number of disks.

printf("enter a number of disks : ");: Displays a message asking the user to input the number of disks.

scanf("%d", &n);: Reads the user's input and stores it in the variable n.

tower(n, 'A', 'B', 'C');: Calls the tower function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks, using source peg 'A', helper peg 'B', and destination peg 'C'.

return 0;: Indicates that the program has executed successfully.

In summary, this code defines a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and uses it in the main function to demonstrate the movement of disks for the specified number of disks.
